This is a group me bot that has the capablity to send text and images to group chats. It is just a project that I am doing for fun.

This uses heroku as a server to operate the bot and the code currently has not been documented which I will do eventualy.

There is also functionality to access google drive to pull informaiton from google sheets. It is in a very basic form where you can only pull infromation from a cell to act as a basic database. To use the google drive funtionality you must get creditentional from https://cloud.google.com/ where you have to get it as a .json file and place it in the same folder as the .py file.

This is one of the first things i have coded so I am aware it is a mess so any critiques would be highly welcomed.
